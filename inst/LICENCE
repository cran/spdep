Spatial dependence: weighting schemes, statistics and models

A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
objects from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and
tesselations, for summarising these objects, and for permitting their
use in spatial data analysis; a collection of tests for spatial
autocorrelation, including global Moran's I and Geary's C, local Moran's I,
saddlepoint approximations for global and local Moran's I; and functions for
estimating spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models.
