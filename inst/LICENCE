Spatial dependence: weighting schemes, statistics and models

A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix objects from
polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and tesselations,
for summarising these objects, and for permitting their use in spatial
data analysis; a collection of tests for spatial autocorrelation,
including global Moran's I, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel general cross product
statistic, Empirical Bayes estimates and spatial Index, and Getis/Ord G,
local Moran's I and Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint approximations for global
and local Moran's I; and functions for estimating spatial simultaneous
autoregressive (SAR) lag and error models, weighted and unweighted
SAR and CAR spatial regression models, and GM SAR error models.
