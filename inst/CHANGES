0.3-9 Removal of the Berkeley sparse code; correction of a bug found by
	Yong Cai inn subset.nb() which was wrong when the neighbour
	list had no-neighbour entities.

0.3-* Introduction of dependence on the SparseM package, and use of the 
	determinant function there for the Jacobian

0.2-23 Added machine fuzz to max distance in dnearneigh()

0.2-18 Removed read.shape() from example(nc.sids) because of odd problems 
	building Windows binary for CRAN, polylist object and centroids 
	added to nc.sids.rda.

0.2-17 Further changes to poly2nb() reducing a 40 hour run for 44K polygons 
	in Australia to 11 hours. Added p.adjustSP() with Danlin Yu for 
	adjusting p-values for local statistics.

0.2-16 Added text to help page for tri2nb() to show ways of triangulating 
	on a grid; added nb2blocknb to fill out an nb object with spatial
	"replications" that have to neighbour each other; poly2nb() altered
	to use the pythag() C function internally, rather than creating several 	large matrices - this should alleviate memory problems.

0.2-14 Dependency on R-1.9.0 because findInterval() in R altered to help 
	with map class interval finding, making a modified local copy
	superfluous.

earlier briefly:

because spdep depends on the maptools package, it must be present for 
	spdep to load correctly.

all after 0.2-5: error in errorsarlm() and lagsarlm() corrected - 
	the error was the silent assumption that all lagged intercepts
	followed "W" style weights, not the actual weights being used.
