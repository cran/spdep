# Version 1.1-8 (development)

* #55 related to #20 and cycling order in setting up grids provoked re-design of interface to `cell2nb()`, with passing of `"GridTopology"` or `"SpatialGrid"` objects as unnamed first or `x=` argument. Coerce `"RasterLayer"` or similar **raster**, **terra** or **stars** objects to **sp** class objects first if need be.

* In working with renewing the arguments to `cell2nb()`, it was useful to add **tinytest** support, which is now present for this function and may be extended to other functions for creating `"nb"` objects.

* #58 contributed by Jeff Sauer and Levi Wolf (from https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/ugkhp) providing conditional standard deviates for local Moran's I

* Error in assignment to matrix detected by CRAN check in SIDS vignette, section on median polish

# Version 1.1-7 (2021-04-03)

* Changes to continuous integration and vignettes.

* Error in `poly2nb(, queen=FALSE)` in **sf** grids (double counting of closed polygon start/end points), https://github.com/r-spatial/spdep/issues/50, thanks to Christopher Kenny.

* Adding local Moran and local G conditional permutation: `localmoran_perm()` and `localG_perm()`.

* Adding `nb2listwdist()` contributed by RenÃ© Westerholt.

* Adding use of **sf** through GEOS to find polygon contiguity candidates in `poly2nb()` if geometry count >= 500 - uses intersections in polygon envelopes.

* #38, #53 removing **RANN**, adding **dbscan** suggestions for fast `dnearneigh()` and `knearneigh()` via `use_kd_tree=` argument for fast planar neighbour set finding in 2D and 3D. Affects `soi.graph()` too, which had used **RANN**.

* #54 avoid partial matching in `glist=` handling.

* Disambiguating **spdep** and **spatialreg** model output object class names prior to making **spdep** model fitting functions defunct.

# Version 1.1-5 (2020-06-29)

* Replacing broken geoda URLs, moving knitr to rmarkdown, work-around missing weights files in spData.


# Version 1.1-3 (2019-09-18)

* A small maintenance update to accommodate a forthcoming change in spData (a dataset used in an example in spdep from spData is changing its name;   the name had involved putting "x", "y" and "xyz" in the global environment through lazy loading a dataset).


# Version 1.1-2 (2019-04-05)

* Follow-up version of spdep with all the functions and 
  methods transferred to the spatialreg package marked 
  as deprecated, but still exported from spdep. Reverse 
  dependencies passing with the released version still 
  pass for me with this version.
