Description: A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
        objects from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by
        distance and tesselations, for summarising these objects, and
        for permitting their use in spatial data analysis, including
        regional aggregation by minimum spanning tree; a collection of
        tests for spatial autocorrelation, including global Moran's I,
        APLE, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel general cross product statistic,
        Empirical Bayes estimates and Assunção/Reis Index, Getis/Ord G
        and multicoloured join count statistics, local Moran's I and
        Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint approximations and exact tests for
        global and local Moran's I; and functions for estimating
        spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) lag and error models,
        impact measures for lag models, weighted and unweighted SAR and
        CAR spatial regression models, semi-parametric and Moran
        eigenvector spatial filtering, GM SAR error models, and
        generalized spatial two stage least squares models.
