Description: A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
  objects from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and
  tesselations, for summarising these objects, and for permitting their
  use in spatial data analysis; a collection of tests for spatial
  autocorrelation, including global Moran's I, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel
  general cross product statistic, and Getis/Ord G, local Moran's I and
  Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint approximations for global and local Moran's I;
  and functions for estimating spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR)
  models. Was formerly the three packages: spweights, sptests, and spsarlm.
