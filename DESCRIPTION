Description: A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
  objects from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and
  tesselations, for summarising these objects, and for permitting their
  use in spatial data analysis; a collection of tests for spatial
  autocorrelation, including global Moran's I, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel
  general cross product statistic, Empirical Bayes estimates and spatial
  Index, and Getis/Ord G, local Moran's I and Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint
  approximations for global and local Moran's I; and functions for
  estimating spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models.
