Description: A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix
  objects from polygon contiguities (including the creation of polygon
  lists from imported shapefiles), from point patterns by distance and
  tesselations, for summarising these objects, and for permitting their
  use in spatial data analysis; a collection of tests for spatial
  autocorrelation, including global Moran's I, Geary's C, Hubert/Mantel
  general cross product statistic, Empirical Bayes estimates and Assunção/Reis
  Index, Getis/Ord G and multicoloured join count statistics, 
  local Moran's I and Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint approximations for global
  and local Moran's I; and functions for estimating spatial simultaneous
  autoregressive (SAR) models.
